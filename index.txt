Notes:
HTML - HyperText Markup Language
DOCTYPE - tells the web browser how to render the page, set this to html
HTML - The main wrapper of the page
HEAD -  meta information about the page and styles
LINK - includes files, rel tells browser the type of file
BODY - Content of the page
HEADER - top of page, contains logo
DIV - simple wrapper, can be used for anything, target with a class/ID
A - anchor tag, use to create links on page
NAV - navigation wrapper, with a UL inside
UL - unordered list, used to create a list of items
LI - a list item
MAIN - main content of web page
SECTION - a section of content
H1 - main heading of the page, only allowed 1 of these per page
H2 - secondary heading, we are alllowed multiple
IMG - use to include an image, important to include an alt value for blind people, must be dscriptive of image
P - a paragraph of text
HR - a horizontal rule, used as a visual break to seperate content
FOOTER - bottom of the page, includes footnote, credits
BR - a line break, makes text appear on new line

** Every element must have an opening and closing tag, exceptions to this are LINK and IMG as these can self close.

to close an element, it must have the same value are the opening element, with the difference of a leading / before the element name.

Examples:
<div>Content</div>
<header>logo</header>

exception example:

<img src="image.jpg" alt="A horse in a field" />

ID = id of an element, cannot be repeated I.E. id="id-name"
CLASS = class of an element, can be repeated, can have multiple values, I.E. class= "class-name another-class-name"
ALT = alternate value, used on an IMG tag I.E. <img src="image.jpg" alt="a horse in a field" />
TITLE = use on a A to describe links destination


.......................................
Phase 1:
* Simple webpage, content and images provided via Wikipedia

Phase 2:
* Content split onto multiple pages, content updated and improved where required.
* improve mobile appearance.

            <p>Solar energy, radiant light and heat from the sun, is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis.[32][33] Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air. Active solar technologies encompass solar thermal energy, using solar collectors for heating, and solar power, converting sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP).</p>
            <p>A photovoltaic system converts light into electrical direct current (DC) by taking advantage of the photoelectric effect.[34] Solar PV has turned into a multi-billion, fast-growing industry, continues to improve its cost-effectiveness, and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with CSP.[35][36] Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. CSP-Stirling has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies.</p>

            <h2>Windfarm Energy</h2>
            <img src="img/windfarm.jpg" alt="Windfarm example" class="image-top-right" />
            <p>
              Airflows can be used to run wind turbines. Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kW to 5 MW of rated power, although turbines with rated output of 1.53 MW have become the most common for commercial use; the power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine.[27] Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Typical capacity factors are 20-40%, with values at the upper end of the range in particularly favorable sites.[28][29]
            </p>
            <p>
              Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land stationed turbines.[30] In 2013 wind generated almost 3% of the worlds total electricity.[17]

          <h2>Hydropower Energy</h2>
          <img src="img/hydro.jpg" alt="Solar energy example" class="image-top-right" />
          <p>Energy in water can be harnessed and used. Since water is about 800 times denser than air, even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate sea swell, can yield considerable amounts of energy. There are many forms of water energy:</p>
          <p>
            Wave power, which captures the energy of ocean surface waves, and tidal power, converting the energy of tides, are two forms of hydropower with future potential; however, they are not yet widely employed commercially. A demonstration project operated by the Ocean Renewable Power Company on the coast of Maine, and connected to the grid, harnesses tidal power from the Bay of Fundy, location of world's highest tidal flow. Ocean thermal energy conversion, which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters, has currently no economic feasibility. In 2013 hydropower generated almost 16% of the worlds total electricity.[17]
